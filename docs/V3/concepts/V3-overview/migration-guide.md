## Migration Guide

The following steps outline how to migrate liquidity from v2 to v3:

1. On the Uniswap v3 interface, click on the "Pool" page. Any positions you open in v3 will appear here.
2. To migrate your v2 liquidity, click "Migrate v2 Liquidity". This will display which pairs you're currently providing liquidity for in v2. 
3. Click "Manage" next to the pair you want to mirgate over to v3. 
4. Then click "Migrate". On this screen, you'll be ale to choose the fee tier for the pool and the price range. 
When the price for that pair falls between the range you specify, your liquidity is considered "active", meaning it is actively earning fees. 
At this point, you are also able to choose what asset to display the price in and what the current price of the asset is.  
4. To finalize your new v3 range for your v3 liquidity, click Unlock LP tokens, approve in your wallet, and confirm.
5. Once it confirms, you should be able to see this v3 position on the Pool page.
